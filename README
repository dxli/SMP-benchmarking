Benchmarking multi-process performance on SMP(multi-core, and hyperthreading)

Speed of each instance is measured against number of running copies.

Depends on grace( http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/ ) for plotting.

To build,

        ./autogen.sh

To benchmark for up to 8 simultaneous running processes,
        ./ht 8
